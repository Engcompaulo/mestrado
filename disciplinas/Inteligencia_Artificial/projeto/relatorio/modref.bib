abstract = {Aqueous pollen extracts of varying taxonomic relations were analyzed with surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) by using gold nanoparticles in aqueous suspen- sions as SERS substrate. This enables a selective vibra- tional characterization of the pollen water soluble fraction (mostly cellular components) devoid of the spectral con- tributions from the insoluble sporopollenin outer layer. The spectra of the pollen extracts are species-specific, and the chemical fingerprints can be exploited to achieve a classification that can distinguish between different spe- cies of the same genus. In the simple experimental proce- dure, several thousands of spectra per species are gener- ated. Using an artificial neural network (ANN), it is de- monstrated that analysis of the intrinsic biochemical infor- mation of the pollen cells in the SERS data enables the identification of pollen from different plant species at high accuracy. The ANN extracts the taxonomically-relevant information from the data in spite of high intra-species spectral variation caused by signal fluctuations and pre- paration specifics. The results show that SERS can be used for the reliable characterization and identification of pollen samples. They have implications for improved in- vestigation of pollen physiology and for allergy warning.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1983-2012 IEEE. The growing market of artisanal alcoholic beverages have faced challenges to assess the quality of the commercialized products. Contaminated beverages, resulting not only from an uncontrolled production process but also from deliberate adulteration, may contain nonsafe amounts of methanol leading to risks for consumers. Ethanol and methanol share similar physical-chemical properties. Both are colorless, soluble in water, and they have very close values of density. Although analytical laboratorial methods can precisely determine the alcoholic composition, rapid distinction between them is a conundrum. This paper proposes and compares two methods that can be used to fast detect the contamination of alcoholic beverages with methanol. Despite the proximity between densities of methanol and ethanol, as well as the close refractive indexes of methanol and water, it is shown that these macroscopic parameters can be used together to analyze the beverage composition. Additionally, using the fingerprinting molecular analysis provided by Raman spectroscopy and a statistical procedure based on principal component analysis, it is shown a rapid method for the detection of methanol presence in beverages above a pre-established level, without the need for addition of any standard to the sample. The performances of both methods were tested and validated with samples containing different amounts of water, ethanol, and methanol and beverages deliberately contaminated with methanol.},

@article{Lee2015,
abstract = {Of the over 250 Aspergillus species, Aspergillus fumigatus accounts for up to 80{\%} of invasive human infections. A. fumigatus produces galactosaminogalactan (GAG), an exopolysaccharide composed of galactose and N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc) that mediates adherence and is required for full virulence. Less pathogenic Aspergillus species were found to produce GAG with a lower GalNAc content than A. fumigatus and expressed minimal amounts of cell wall-bound GAG. Increasing the GalNAc content of GAG of the minimally pathogenic A. nidulans, either through overexpression of the A. nidulans epimerase UgeB or by heterologous expression of the A. fumigatus epimerase Uge3 increased the amount of cell wall bound GAG, augmented adherence in vitro and enhanced virulence in corticosteroid-treated mice to levels similar to A. fumigatus. The enhanced virulence of the overexpression strain of A. nidulans was associated with increased resistance to NADPH oxidase-dependent neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in vitro, and was not observed in neutropenic mice or mice deficient in NADPH-oxidase that are unable to form NETs. Collectively, these data suggest that cell wall-bound GAG enhances virulence through mediating resistance to NETs.},

abstract = {Raman spectroscopy can be used to measure the chemical composition of a sample, which can in turn be used to extract biological information. Many materials have characteristic Raman spectra, which means that Raman spectroscopy has proven to be an effective analytical approach in geology, semiconductor, materials and polymer science fields. The application of Raman spectroscopy and microscopy within biology is rapidly increasing because it can provide chemical and compositional information, but it does not typically suffer from interference from water molecules. Analysis does not conventionally require extensive sample preparation; biochemical and structural information can usually be obtained without labeling. In this protocol, we aim to standardize and bring together multiple experimental approaches from key leaders in the field for obtaining Raman spectra using a microspectrometer. As examples of the range of biological samples that can be analyzed, we provide instructions for acquiring Raman spectra, maps and images for fresh plant tissue, formalin-fixed and fresh frozen mammalian tissue, fixed cells and biofluids. We explore a robust approach for sample preparation, instrumentation, acquisition parameters and data processing. By using this approach, we expect that a typical Raman experiment can be performed by a nonspecialist user to generate high-quality data for biological materials analysis.},

abstract = {Tools for mineral identification based on Raman spectroscopy fall into two groups: those that are largely based on fits to diagnostic peaks associated with specific phases, and those that use the entire spectral range for multivariate analyses. In this project, we apply machine learning techniques to improve mineral identification using the latter group. We test the effects of common spectrum preprocessing steps, such as intensity normalization, smoothing, and squashing, and found that the last is superior. Next, we demonstrate that full-spectrum matching algorithms exhibit excellent performance in classification tasks, without requiring time-intensive dimensionality reduction or model training. This class of algorithms supports both vector and trajectory input formats, exploiting all available spectral information. By combining these insights, we find that optimal mineral spectrum matching performance can be achieved using careful preprocessing and a weighted-neighbors classifier based on a vector similarity metric.},
