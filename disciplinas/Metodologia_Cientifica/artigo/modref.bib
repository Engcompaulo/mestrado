abstract = {Aqueous pollen extracts of varying taxonomic relations were analyzed with surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) by using gold nanoparticles in aqueous suspen- sions as SERS substrate. This enables a selective vibra- tional characterization of the pollen water soluble fraction (mostly cellular components) devoid of the spectral con- tributions from the insoluble sporopollenin outer layer. The spectra of the pollen extracts are species-specific, and the chemical fingerprints can be exploited to achieve a classification that can distinguish between different spe- cies of the same genus. In the simple experimental proce- dure, several thousands of spectra per species are gener- ated. Using an artificial neural network (ANN), it is de- monstrated that analysis of the intrinsic biochemical infor- mation of the pollen cells in the SERS data enables the identification of pollen from different plant species at high accuracy. The ANN extracts the taxonomically-relevant information from the data in spite of high intra-species spectral variation caused by signal fluctuations and pre- paration specifics. The results show that SERS can be used for the reliable characterization and identification of pollen samples. They have implications for improved in- vestigation of pollen physiology and for allergy warning.},

abstract = {Raman spectroscopy can be used to measure the chemical composition of a sample, which can in turn be used to extract biological information. Many materials have characteristic Raman spectra, which means that Raman spectroscopy has proven to be an effective analytical approach in geology, semiconductor, materials and polymer science fields. The application of Raman spectroscopy and microscopy within biology is rapidly increasing because it can provide chemical and compositional information, but it does not typically suffer from interference from water molecules. Analysis does not conventionally require extensive sample preparation; biochemical and structural information can usually be obtained without labeling. In this protocol, we aim to standardize and bring together multiple experimental approaches from key leaders in the field for obtaining Raman spectra using a microspectrometer. As examples of the range of biological samples that can be analyzed, we provide instructions for acquiring Raman spectra, maps and images for fresh plant tissue, formalin-fixed and fresh frozen mammalian tissue, fixed cells and biofluids. We explore a robust approach for sample preparation, instrumentation, acquisition parameters and data processing. By using this approach, we expect that a typical Raman experiment can be performed by a nonspecialist user to generate high-quality data for biological materials analysis.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1983-2012 IEEE. The growing market of artisanal alcoholic beverages have faced challenges to assess the quality of the commercialized products. Contaminated beverages, resulting not only from an uncontrolled production process but also from deliberate adulteration, may contain nonsafe amounts of methanol leading to risks for consumers. Ethanol and methanol share similar physical-chemical properties. Both are colorless, soluble in water, and they have very close values of density. Although analytical laboratorial methods can precisely determine the alcoholic composition, rapid distinction between them is a conundrum. This paper proposes and compares two methods that can be used to fast detect the contamination of alcoholic beverages with methanol. Despite the proximity between densities of methanol and ethanol, as well as the close refractive indexes of methanol and water, it is shown that these macroscopic parameters can be used together to analyze the beverage composition. Additionally, using the fingerprinting molecular analysis provided by Raman spectroscopy and a statistical procedure based on principal component analysis, it is shown a rapid method for the detection of methanol presence in beverages above a pre-established level, without the need for addition of any standard to the sample. The performances of both methods were tested and validated with samples containing different amounts of water, ethanol, and methanol and beverages deliberately contaminated with methanol.},
